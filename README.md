First HTML Project

My process:
1. Visited the website of four or five different zoos
2. Made a moodboard on Canva with different headers, navbars, content, pictures, footers that I clipped with Sharex to not only get stills.
3. Worked my way to a color palette that works well with a zoo. Thanks coolors.co. <3
4. Started building social media buttons with fontawesome.
Building header/navbar and footer as isolated parts with inspiration from the moodboard.
6. Designed a card model to use with thumbnail, subtext and a h3. To use on this Zoo and to reuse for my portfolio project later.
7. A lot of fiddling in main. Trying widths, heights, spacing, max widths etc.
8. Designed the logo (or Canva AI did. Yay! \o/ )
9. Lorem and placeholder images.
10. Browsing for animals on unsplashed.com. Credit below.
11. Responsive Design. Settled on three sizes.
12. Unfixed footer for it to not always show, and changed colour palette to match a background created in Canva.
13. Contact section. Forms and Google map.
14. Great lesson! Will do a lot different the next time and I'm 100% sure the same thought will hit me in the head at the end of that one anyways :)
